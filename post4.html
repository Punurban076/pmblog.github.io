									At the close of 2017 and the beginning of an exciting new year in 2018, I reflected on what made me a better photographer and what helped me grow.  My photography endeavors aren't a full time job like I would love them to be, but instead, it is a self sustaining side business that makes enough money to keep taking pictures and buying expensive new gear.  To start off this new year, let's go over a number of things I've learned that might help you be better at your photography and develop your career (if you choose to go that route).  I'm hopeful that eventually, I'll be able to sustain my family on some kind of photography work.

							   1. Printing...

							   The biggest improvements I saw to my photography started when I began printing my work.  The most improvement I saw came in the form of boosting the overall exposure.

							   2. Scouting... 

							   I used to just show up to a location and expect to get a great shot.  This can happen but getting lucky is not something you should have as the foundation of your photography business.  Scouting a location will help you manage your time and plan for the best photo.  There are times where I will scout a location 2 or 3 times before ever taking out my camera.

							   3. Aspect ratios and horizon flipping...

							   Different aspect ratios will give your photos a different look and feel.  When shooting and editing, consider testing out different aspect ratios than the standard 2×3 that most cameras shoot in.  Try panoramas (1×3 or 1×2 ratios) or square crops (1×1) to give your photos a unique look.

							   4. Falling into a river...

							   When I was out trying to get shots of a winter scene with a river, I was crossing a snow covered log and fell into waist deep, ice cold water.  Luckily I didn't have my phone or keys in my pocket and I was able to hold my camera above the water.  Instead of getting upset, I just laughed.  Then I tried to see what compositions I could get from the middle of the river.

							   5. Budgeting...

							   This year I learned to be more careful about what I spent my money on.  My photography business isn't pulling in millions of dollars so I have to be choosey about what I buy.  This includes everything from new gear, tutorials, and even snacks for road trips.  I used to just buy whatever I saw that looked cool (that Z-shaped camera mount thing that was on Facebook for a while) as long as I had money in my account for it.

							   6. Getting my camera stolen...


							   This was an awful thing to happen and I sympathize with anyone who has had anything stolen.  I brought my camera bag into work to take some photos off the memory card (why I didn't just bring in the memory card I'll never know) and I left the bag on my desk overnight.  The next morning it was gone.

							   7. Giving away prints...

							   Giving away prints as gifts helped me to understand the value of photography and fine art.  It also helped me know how to shoot and edit so I could create something that I would be proud to give someone else.  Giving away prints was a wonderful way to get to know different printers, different qualities, and different mediums (paper, canvas, metal, etc).

							   8. Going on a photography trip (with other photographers)...

							   Being able to collaborate with other photographers for a few days was a huge step forward for me personally and professionally.  Not only did I develop relationships with some great photographers. but I was able to understand the nuance and etiquette of shooting with other people.  Things like where to stand, how close you can get to someone else, “stealing” someone's composition, and when it's ok to use your flashlight when shooting the milky way were all valuable lessons that can't be learned anywhere else.

							   9. Tutorials...

							   Whether it be paid tutorials from established photographers, or free tutorials from YouTube, any learning you can do will greatly enhance your shooting and editing skills.  Subscribing to Photoshop tutorials on YouTube helps me to learn neat tips and tricks from the pros and see things about editing that I didn't know where possible.  Reading articles about how to use blend modes helps me to know the appropriate situations to use them.

							   10. Practice in public...
 
						       This was a concept I learned about in the book Real Artists Don't Starve by Jeff Goins.  It is important for artists to practice their craft in public, going on display as they develop their skills.  This helps them get better faster and energizes them to continue producing. </p>
