									Social media has indeed made the world interestingly smaller than before. It even made human interaction easier than 1, 2, 3. Combined with the newest technological innovations in the field of communication, the social media platform became more powerful especially in the world of business. Let’s set Facebook as an example. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Facebook had 2.32 billion monthly active users. Imagine how wide this marketing platform is for business owners to promote their individual brands. This is the reason why social media marketing (SMM) bombed its way through to this globally renowned mediated world. Although social media advertising has been around even before Facebook came into the picture, the technological evolution in online marketing was able to bring it forward to this day. 

For some business owners, social media advertising made marketing a walk in the park because of the vast number of potential targets that they can introduce their products to. However, some business enthusiasts might have to disagree with the “extraordinary benefits” that social media marketing can provide to businesses. Some business companies consider social media sites as a double-edged sword because it can either make or break a business. So, is social media marketing really good or bad for businesses? Let’s try to further understand the effects of social media advertising in business marketing from an argumentative standpoint. Why is it good or why is it bad? Let’s go ahead and dig into their advantages and disadvantages.

What Are The Advantages of Social Media Advertising in Business Marketing?
Increasing Brand Awareness 
Creating a social media profile for your business to gain visibility is an exceedingly powerful way to increase brand awareness.  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. These social networking sites can be of good use when it comes to marketing your brand. The wider your audience reach is, the more exposure you can get. The social media platform is greatly beneficial especially for new businesses since they already have the means to expose their brand publicly. In fact, social media has become such a staple marketing strategy that even hotels are joining in and winning the social media game. 

Customer Engagement
Engaging with customers is a fundamental factor in marketing and boosting conversion rates that businesses have been promoting for many years. Through customer engagement, business owners can effectively build a lasting relationship with their customers. As a platform created mainly for communication, social media advertising and usage can make customer engagement an everyday routine for businesses. This allows business owners to interact with their customers and build a good relationship in an up to date manner.

Keeping Track of Competitors 
With the use of social media advertising tools like Facebook Ads, business owners can research their competitors latest trends. This can help them formulate better marketing strategies to match up or exceed their competitor’s marketing development.

Accessible Consumer Insights
The vast majority of social media users are pretty vocal about their opinions on the latest trends.  This can help business owners identify their consumers’ wants and needs, and apply these insights to their marketing strategy to increase product sales and build a splendid brand impression.

It’s Mostly Free
Creating a business profile in social media is mostly for free. Let’s take a Facebook page as an example. As an administrator, you can easily create a page for your business on Facebook.  You can promote your products for free through a public post and you can even share it with your friends without having to pay a single penny. Although boosting your content’s audience reach is not for free, the fact that you have the freedom to post about your brand is already incredibly helpful.

Now, let’s go ahead and check out the disadvantages of social media advertising to business owners and to their corresponding businesses.

What Are The Disadvantages?
Negative Feedback 
One viral negative feedback can hit a business harder than a knockout punch. This a pressingly important factor to consider for business owners. Almost everything in the social media platform is shareable which means that one negative feedback can impact almost everyone. This could break customer trust and ruin brand perception for both business owners and their businesses; though you can still respond to negative feedback, learn here how to manage negative reviews.

Time-Consuming
It may sound like an easy task, but social media advertising requires a lot of time and patience. You may also need like a year worth of luck just to get immediate results. Social media marketing is a gradual process and requires high consistency in order for the business to be known.

High Volume of Contents
Due to the heavy amount of contents from other social media users, searching for a particular business is like finding a needle in a haystack. For business owners, this means that increasing brand awareness is not as easy as it actually sounds.

Susceptibility to Misleading Information
It is not a secret that social media contains a lot of fake news and contents. These could possibly mislead multiple numbers of users. In a real case scenario, negative feedback can trigger these types of misleading information to be spread. These can eventually destroy a business’ reputation on a large scale.

Possible Security Breach
Although some social media applications and websites are highly protected, there is still a risk for a possible security breach from online hackers. And although this disadvantage rarely happens, the stakes are higher for business owners when it happens.

Clearly, both the advantages and disadvantages of social media advertising in marketing can impact businesses on a positive and negative note.  Moreover, it is more important to be aware of these factors before getting into the hype. Understanding the possible effects of using social media marketing can help business owners strategize efficiently for the betterment of their businesses. In conclusion, whether it’s good or bad, social media marketing needs to be handled critically and should be tailor-fitted accordingly to the type of business an owner has. Traditional marketing is still largely used by many people and is proven to be effective. Thus, using social media advertising as a form of marketing is still just a matter of preference for business owners.
