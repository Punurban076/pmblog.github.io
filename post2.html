								<p>A freelancer or freelance worker is a self-employed person who earns money by providing services to multiple clients. These services relate to the person’s skills and are not necessarily provided to just businesses. Freelancers either use third-party platforms like Fiverr, 99designs, etc. to get business or use their network to get more business and provide services to their clients directly. But is it a good choice for a career? Can you sustain a lavish life while freelancing? How do you start with freelancing jobs? Well, when 11 percent of the working adult population in the United States is working primarily as full-time freelancers, there must be something good about this industry.</p>
								<p>Freelancing As A Career The rise of freelancers has resulted in the development of a new concept – the gig economy. In the gig economy, a person, instead of working for a single employer full-time and getting a fixed salary in return, works for multiple clients at his own terms and at a price he thinks his work deserves. Freelancing is an enticing profession. It takes care of almost all the problems of a usual service-class human. According to Upwork, Americans work an average of 47 hours per week. Freelancers work an average of 11 hours less per week than full-time employed workers. That adds up to about 550 hours per year or 23 whole days. Full-time traditional workers spend nearly an additional full month each year behind the keyboard (or wherever they work). freelance stats Source: Freelancinghacks.com Here’s the annual salary of freelancers in America from 2014 till 2018: freelancing salary All this along with advantages like freedom to work from anywhere at a time of your choice, being your own boss, keeping all the profits, and a lower cost of operating surely attracts a lot of people to take freelancing as careers. But not many ends up pursuing it full time. Why, you ask? Well, the answer is basically embedded in our human psyche. It is deeply rooted in our minds to look for a guarantee. A regular job provides us with a guarantee of a profession that pays at the specified time. You get a routine to follow. And this job also provides with guaranteed perks such as insurance, retirement benefits, provident fund, increments and salary hikes for performing well. When you opt for freelancing, you lose the guarantee of any of this. There’s no surety that you’ll get recurring clients. No surety that you’ll be able to sustain this lifestyle till retirement, and even no guarantee that your income will ever increase. Moreover, you get to handle your tax deductions, insurance, and other finances yourself. There are also other cons to freelancing such as – Work-life balance: If you don’t know how to separate personal life from work, freelancing becomes tougher than a regular nine to five job. No benefits: Freelancers are in charge of their own holidays, sick days, vacations and must be good financial and time-management planners. Difficult Clients: You may find some clients who are extremely difficult to manage. They may fail in giving the right instructions and information for completing the job or may be inaccessible to clear any doubts. This can be frustrating and might result in wasting your time. There are always pros and cons to every profession and it’s up to you to balance it properly for a healthy footing. If you think freelancing could be beneficial for you and the cons don’t matter much. Read on to find out how you can become a freelancer.</p>
