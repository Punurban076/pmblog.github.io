											<p>
											Driving the Car of Your Dreams
yellow sports car in city
Life is short. Why drive a car you don’t really like, when the car of your dreams might be within your reach? We talked to several people about what it’s like to drive your dream car, and they shared their best advice.

When someone asks, “What is your dream car?” there’s no wrong answer.
Your dream car might be a Ford Ranger pickup like the one your uncle used to drive. It might be an adorable Fiat in mocha brown. Or it might be an orange Trans Am with a Screaming Chicken painted on the hood. Trends and taste have nothing to do with true car love.

When you drive your dream car, it’s all about the behind-the-wheel feel.
You might like the look of a particular car, but if you don’t love driving it, it’s not going to work for you. Dream cars deserve to be driven, not kept in a garage gathering dust.

											<h2><a href="post1.html">My Dream House</a></h2>
											<p>
											Describe your dream house.

My dream house is a cottage not far from the sea. On the ground-floor, there are four rooms. The first room is my livingroom, which has a white sofa, a black armchair and a cofee table. There are lots of paintings and trinkets as well. There is also a lamp, French windows with a view of the garden, a television set and a phone in the livingroom. My dream house has a fully-equiped kitchen, including a fridge and a door to the garden. There is a bathroom with a shower and toilet. There is also a study room where I keep my desk and computer. On the first floor, there are three bedrooms and a bathroom. In my bedroom, there is a wardrobe; a bed, of course; a bedside table; many pictures of me; and a television set. There is a balcony with a view of the sea. My house is really beautiful and spacious. It's big and expensive, but in my dream, I am rich. In the garden, there are a lot of fruit trees. There is a patio in front of the house from which I can see the driveway and front gate. The walls of the house are white, which I chose because it is pure and fresh, and I love it. And all of the windows have blinds.

											<h2><a href="post3.html">Good or Bad? The Advantages of Advertising Using Social Media and It’s Down Side</a></h2>
											<p>
											Social media has indeed made the world interestingly smaller than before. It even made human interaction easier than 1, 2, 3. Combined with the newest technological innovations in the field of communication, the social media platform became more powerful especially in the world of business. Let’s set Facebook as an example. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Facebook had 2.32 billion monthly active users. Imagine how wide this marketing platform is for business owners to promote their individual brands. This is the reason why social media marketing (SMM) bombed its way through to this globally renowned mediated world. Although social media advertising has been around even before Facebook came into the picture, the technological evolution in online marketing was able to bring it forward to this day. 

For some business owners, social media advertising made marketing a walk in the park because of the vast number of potential targets that they can introduce their products to. However, some business enthusiasts might have to disagree with the “extraordinary benefits” that social media marketing can provide to businesses. Some business companies consider social media sites as a double-edged sword because

Like other countries in the world, Bangladesh is passing through a hard time now for Covid-19 pandemic which is attacking all groups of people physically, mentally, financially and so on. Undoubtedly, this pandemic is going to bring a harsh future for Bangladesh's large number of young unemployed population. The condition will be more terrible especially for new graduates who are going to have a job in post covid-19 period.

											<h2><a href="post1.html">Digital Bangladesh</a></h2>
											<p>
											Digital Bangladesh is one of the nation's dreams, and so special emphasis is given on the application of digital technologies to realise Vision 2021, which we commonly call Digital Bangladesh. By 2021, after 50 years of independence, our goal is to be a middle-income country with peace, prosperity and dignity. The government of Bangladesh implemented a large number of projects relating to digital technologies and a number of these are already underway. National ICT Policy-2009 was developed with a view to achieve middle-income status of the nation by 2021 and developed status by 2041. 
The World Bank classifies economies as low-income, middle-income and high-income groups. The Per Capita Gross National Income (GNI) is the basis of the classification. Low-income and middle-income countries are referred to as developing countries. Per Capita GNI is the dollar value of a country's income in a year, divided by its population.
