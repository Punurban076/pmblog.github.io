											<p>
											Freelancing is a contract-based profession where instead of being recruited in an organisation, the person uses his skills and experience to provide services to a number of clients. In simple terms, freelancing is when you use your skills, education, and experience to work with multiple clients and take on various assignments without committing to a single employer..

											10 Things That Helped Grow My Photography Career::::::

											At the close of 2017 and the beginning of an exciting new year in 2018, I reflected on what made me a better photographer and what helped me grow.  My photography endeavors aren't a full time job like I would love them to be, but instead, it is a self sustaining side business that makes enough money to keep taking pictures and buying expensive new gear.  To start off this new year, let's go over a number of things I've learned that might help you be better at your photography and develop your career (if you choose to go that route).  I'm hopeful that eventually, I'll be able to sustain my family on some kind of photography work.



											1. Printing

											The biggest improvements I saw to my photography started when I began printing my work.  The most improvement I saw came in the form of boosting the overall exposure.  What looks great on a computer screen or a phone might not look great as a print.  But what does look great as a print will look absolutely phenomenal on a screen.  I found that most of my photos were too dark, and when printed, they looked muddy (not moody) and underexposed.  I would never have realized this if I didn't print the photograph.

											</a></h2>
											<p>
											Apple is reportedly going to release its iPhone 12 lineup on 13 October and the lineup will likely include a 5.4-inch variant, two 6.1-inch models, and a high-end 6.7-inch variant. A recent report suggests that the 5.4-inch iPhone will be an entry-level smartphone and will likely be called the iPhone Mini. The leak further suggests that the 6.1-inch model will be simply called the iPhone 12, which is in contrast with earlier reports that suggested the model will be called iPhone 12 Max. The other two models will be known as iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, according to the leak.
